  the perspective of a user of the system. Example: "As a \<persona\>, I
  want \<what?\> so that \<why?\>"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: a set of statements, each with a clear
  pass/fail result, that specify both functional and non-functional
  requirements.
- **Business value**: a numerical value to represent the importance of
  the User Story for the so called business (actually the customer).
